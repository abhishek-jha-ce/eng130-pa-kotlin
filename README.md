# Kotlin

- Open-source
- Static language (Declaration required e.g. int var = value).
- Designed & developed by `JetBrains`.
- Supports both object-oriented and functional programming.
- Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Syntax similar to languages such as Java, C#, Scala etc.

The name `Kotlin` is based on a Russian island, located near the head of the Gulf of Finland.

Kotlin is `inter-operable` with the Java Programming language. We can easily convert between `Kotlin` and `Java` codes.
- There is also an automatic Java-to-Kotlin converter built into Android Studio.

## Advantage of Kotlin over Java
- Fewer lines of codes.
- Faster Compilation.
- Much simpler and more understandable structure.
- We can also develop Web, Desktop and Android Applications with Kotlin, same like Java.

## Android
Android is an Operating System designed for use on touchscreen Mobile Devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
- It was originally developed as an advanced operating systems for digital cameras.
- It is also used as an OS in Televisions, Smartwatches, Android Auto and Wear devices.
- Used in more than 100 Languages.

# Installations Required

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

**Java Development Kit (JDK)** implements the Java Language Specification (JLS) and the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS) and provides the Standard Edition (SE) of the Java Application Programming Interface (API).

**Java virtual machine (JVM)** is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode like `kotlin`.

**Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** is a software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software and provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run. It contains the *Java class libraries*, the *Java class loader*, and the *Java virtual machine*.
- The **class loader** is responsible for correctly loading classes and connecting them with the core Java class libraries.
- The **JVM** is responsible for ensuring Java applications have the resources they need to run and perform well in your device or cloud environment.
- The **JRE** is mainly a container for those other components, and is responsible for orchestrating their activities.

Together, the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, and the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** form a powerful trifecta of Java for developing and running Java applications. They all work together to let developers build and run Java programs.
